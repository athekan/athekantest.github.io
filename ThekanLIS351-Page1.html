        <p class="museum">The Milwaukee Art Museum has been a stable to the Milwaukee shorline for as long as I can remember. The design of the bulding is so captivating. The way the wings open up is so unique. <br><br> The Milwaukee Art Museum has many events throughout the year and if you are ever in town I would highly recommend going to check it out. Here is a link to the Museums website showing the current exhibits offered by the <a href="https://mam.org/exhibitions/" class="link1">museum.</a></p>
